<h1 id="shopify-api">Shopify API</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview:</h2>
<p>This is a simple server-side web API that might be used by E-commerce companies like Shopify. It models the following relationship:<br />* Users have many shops<br />* Shops have many Products<br />* Shops have many Orders<br />* Products have many Line Items<br />* Orders have many Line Items</p>
<p>Each resource has full CURD operations implemented.</p>
<p>Users would have a key, corresponding to its identity. Different key would have different access privilege. There is a key for the administrator which has the highest privilege, it may get, create, update, delete any resources. Meanwhile, normal user keys may only change resources associated to itself.</p>
<p>Line items refer to any service or product added to an order, along with the quantity and price that pertain to them. For example, if you buy a carton of milk and two loaf of bread at the grocery store, your bill (the representation of your order) will have two line items on it. One for the carton of milk, and the other for two loafs of bread.</p>
<h4 id="todo-in-progress">Todo &amp;&amp; In Progress:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deploy with Docker and GKE</li>
<li>Add pagination for listing resources</li>
<li>Implement usage limit or other limiting measures for premium business model</li>
<li>More thorough testing</li>
<li>Optimize queries and clean up code (use join query)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation:</h2>
<p>Make sure you have:</p>
<pre><code>python 3.6.5 and above</code></pre>
<p>On Linux, simply execute the setup.sh script:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/qinyang-bao/Shopify_Api.git
$ ./setup.sh</code></pre>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/qinyang-bao/Shopify_Api.git
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
<p>There is a sample.env file that you may want to change the env vars to the ones that suit your need, then rename it to .env.<br />I have also included a sample sqlite database file in the repository that does not require any additional setup. But you may also use other databases server(eg. MySQL). To do that, first create a database (remember to change the), then:</p>
<pre><code>$ source venv/bin/activate (or if you are on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
$ (venv) set FLASK_APP=Shopify.py
$ (venv) flask db upgrade</code></pre>
<h2 id="usage">Usage:</h2>
<p>I will discuss the usage of this API by going over each resource (users, shops, products, orders, line_items). You may use curl or the request library of python.</p>
<p>All request would follow the following basic structure:<br />http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/<resource_name>?key=<key>&amp;<other_params>=<value><br />Typically, the parameters in the url are for specifying/locating the resource (eg.id, key).<br />Meanwhile, in the body of the request, you would also include arguments which are typically actual information of the resource (eg. name, price, owner, etc.) You would only need to use the body for POST and PUT requests.</p>
<p>For your convenience, the sqlite database included (app.db) is populated with some sample data. It contains two users, one is the administrator, the other is &quot;Waterloo&quot;. There is one shop &quot;Waterloo bookstore&quot;, owned by &quot;Waterloo&quot;. The shop has one product &quot;MTE 140&quot; and one single order. There is one line item, which is two &quot;MTE 140&quot; and it is on the first order.</p>
<p>The administrator key is &quot;a12b1e7128dged4&quot; which would give you unlimited access of the api.</p>
<h4 id="users">users:</h4>
<h6 id="get-read">GET (read)</h6>
<p>http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/users?key={key}&amp;id={id}&amp;list={true} * parameter &quot;key&quot; is the user key * parameter &quot;id&quot; and &quot;list&quot; are reserved for administrator * specify &quot;id&quot; to get the user information of the user with this id * set &quot;list' to true to list all users * if does not use &quot;list&quot; and &quot;id&quot; parameter (what a normal user would do), return the information of own user (identified by the key)</p>
<p>If only one user information is requested, would return a jason object that contains these attributes: * name: username * id: user id * email: user email * access_key: user key * premium_level: level of premium, access privilege * is_admin: a boolean indicating whether the user is the administrator or not * owned_shops: a list of shops owned by the user. each item in the list is an object that contains attributes: * name: name of the store * id: id of the store</p>
<p>If multiple users information is requested, the returned json would be: * users: a list of user object, each would have the above described attributes</p>
<h6 id="post-create">POST (create)</h6>
<p>http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/users?key={key}<br />Body: username={username}&amp;email={email}&amp;premium_level={premium_level} * parameter &quot;key&quot; is the user key. Only the administrator (identified by key) may create a user * argument &quot;username&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, and &quot;premium_level&quot; must all be present (what they do is self-explanatory)</p>
<p>The returned json object would contain the attributes: * created_user: username * id: user id * email: user email * access_key: user key * premium_level: level of premium, access privilege</p>
<p>You may notice that it does not include &quot;owned_shops&quot; as the GET request would return, this is because when a user is first created, of course it would not have any owned shops. Also, for the response of POST method, I am trying to make it only contain the information about the created resource, excluding information of related resources. I will be keep using this design for the PUT and DELETE request as well. This design is the same for all other resources as well.</p>
<h6 id="put-update">PUT (update)</h6>
